                My name is Carter Hill, and I am a web and custom app developer based in
                Saskatchewan, Canada. For as long as I can remember, I have had a keen
                interest in computer science and technology, and have always made a
                hobby out of creating programs, games, and websites for fun.

                <br></br>

                The purpose of this website is to display my more recent personal projects
                and what I am capable of as a programmer. I take pride in my problem
                solving skills and my ability to apply them in my programming. If you
                are in need of a website for your new business, some kind of custom software,
                or if you have any questions, please visit the contact page to get in touch with me.
